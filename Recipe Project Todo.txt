implement a Recipe::search_global_tags() method to search all tags

implement a Recipe::find_tag_owners()
	finds recipes that contain one of a given tag
implement a Recipe::find_by_tag()

implement a Recipe::search????

create a Recipe::add_recipe(/*fields*/) -> ResultR
	calls add_tags() on a vector of strings
	calls a function (func() -> DateFmt) to convert string to NaiveDate

add a method to convert a Recipe with a date string to a ResultR
	automatically detect the format of the date using the:
		date_format(&str) -> DateFmt 
			Ymd(u32, u32, u32)
			Mdy(u32, u32, u32)
			DateFmt::Fail() for error with msg
			None for fail without error an msg
	detect which format is used, then convert accordingly
	return a ResultR, or Fail(&str) otherwise

maybe make sure that the cid referenced in the Recipe's refer
	to actual existing Contrib's
	check in the add() function in both people and entries, and entries::create()

maybe compress the db files

tags to lowercase on add() not search
add curreny date on recipe/contrib add of blank date/added field

add removecid() and removerid() methods

add editcid() and editrid() methods

Search methods, take a Vec<Recipe> as &self, return a Vec<Recipe>
list_recipes(&self, sortby, asc/desc)			lists all recipes
list_recipes_by(&self, sortby, asc/desc, filterfn)	lists all recipes filtered by a function
search_cid	lists recipes contributed by a specific person
search_cids  	    maybe use the .any() method
search_tags	list recipes with certain tags

list_contribs(&self, sortby, asc/desc)
list_contribs_by(&self, sortby, asc/desc, filterfn)

tag functions
    list_tags()
    create_tag()
    delete_tag()
    change_tag()

add the following:
edit_rid()
delete_rid()

edit_cid()
delete_cid()



date -> NaiveDate
change date in Recipe and added in Contributor to NaiveDate's from the chrono crate
write custom code to implement serialization & deserialization on NaiveDate

add state validation and expansion and contraction methods 
	  to go from wi to wisconsin and vice versa



maybe make a String concatenation overload method
    overload +
        .to_string() the right side and push_str() it to the left







Works:
try changing match statement in search_rid or search_cid from
	Some(r/c) => ..
	to
	Some(ref r/c) => ..
