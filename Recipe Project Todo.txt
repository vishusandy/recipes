add removecid() and removerid() methods

add editcid() and editrid() methods

Search methods, take a Vec<Recipe> as &self, return a Vec<Recipe>
list_recipes(&self, sortby, asc/desc)			lists all recipes
list_recipes_by(&self, sortby, asc/desc, filterfn)	lists all recipes filtered by a function
search_cid	lists recipes contributed by a specific person
search_cids  	    maybe use the .any() method
search_tags	list recipes with certain tags

list_contribs(&self, sortby, asc/desc)
list_contribs_by(&self, sortby, asc/desc, filterfn)

tag functions
    list_tags()
    create_tag()
    delete_tag()
    change_tag()

add the following:
edit_rid()
delete_rid()

edit_cid()
delete_cid()



date -> NaiveDate
change date in Recipe and added in Contributor to NaiveDate's from the chrono crate
write custom code to implement serialization & deserialization on NaiveDate

add state validation and expansion and contraction methods 
	  to go from wi to wisconsin and vice versa



maybe make a String concatenation overload method
    overload +
        .to_string() the right side and push_str() it to the left







Works:
try changing match statement in search_rid or search_cid from
	Some(r/c) => ..
	to
	Some(ref r/c) => ..
